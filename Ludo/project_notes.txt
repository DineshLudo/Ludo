create a website like following-
- login and register
- on homepage we give option to create or join a ludo game.
- anyone create room we show a textfield and he manually enter a room id which he has already. and a room is created.
- and we can show that room with room code in the join games list.
- any other person can join that room by searching that room code in list or by tapping on that row
- there will be wallet in the website by which users can add money via upi.
- and to join or create a room  the will have to pay from wallet. for example anyone is creating a room for 100 rs game. he will have to add 100 rs and for joining that room also other person also needs to add 100 rs.
- after winning the game on that particular ludo app winner will have to upload a screenshot from there account on our website and we will transfer the money to them manually.


Thank you for providing the detailed requirements for your ludo game website. I'll outline a basic structure and provide some code snippets to help you get started with this project. We'll use a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and a backend language like Python with a framework such as Flask or Django. For the database, we can use PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
Here's a high-level overview of the project structure:
User Authentication (Login/Register)
Homepage with game creation and joining options
Room creation and joining functionality
Wallet system with UPI integration
Game result verification and payout system
